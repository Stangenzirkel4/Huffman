Dear Sir/Madam,
I saw an advertisement at your website about hiring volunteers to work in an international summer camp. Im writing to offer my help.
I am 21-year-old student, studying robotics at ITMO University. I am fluent in English and Russian. I am open-minded and very responsible, so it wouldnt be hard for me to become one of your staff members.
I am skilled in communicating with teenagers because I have a lot of practice of working in summer camps in my country. I am also graduated from counselors courses where we learned how to cope with different patterns of teens behavior, communicate with people of their age and resolve conflicts between them.
The other thing is my experience at different touristic and entertainment spheres. I can work as an instructor at hiking, mountain climbing, rafting and be a referee at paintball games. I am also able to teach teens, for example, how to knit different touristic knots, make medieval chainmail or lit a bonfire.
I would like to say, that the camp you are organizing is a really perfect place. Communicating with people from different countries and experiencing their culture is my dream since childhood. I believe I could make a valuable contribution to your programme.
